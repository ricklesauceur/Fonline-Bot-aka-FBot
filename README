Fonline Bot aka FBot
====================

Description
-----------

Partial reverse engineering of the mmorpg based on Fallout universe : FOnline.

The bot can perform basic actions with several security protection bypasses (multiple login, etc).

Within one week, my two automated players reach maximum level without being caught.

Disclaimer
----------

This is not an attempt to hack a game but a good demonstration of basic protocol reverse engineering.

The tool within Futils can be reused to fuse protocol from a wireshark dump.

This is made public because after the public disclosure of several security breaches demonstrated by this program, the game protocol was updated.
